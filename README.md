# Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris Flower Classification project uses the famous Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The main goal is to develop and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on given botanical measurements.
